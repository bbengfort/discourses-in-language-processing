                    ## What is Natural Language Understanding (NLU) ##
                    * Natural language is extremely ambiguous
                    * It is really very difficult to reason with ambiguous premises
                    * NLU = Natural Language --[magic]--> Propositional Logic

                    ## Word Sense Disambiguation ##
                    * If you open a dictionary, you will see most words have several listed senses
                    * WSD is the task of taking an input text and determining which sense
                      each word is representing
                    * This is crucial to NLU - you can't understand text if you don't know what it means.
                    * So, John made a robot.
                        * Did he construct it?
                        * What did he make it do?

                    ## A few methods ##
                    *Gloss method
                    *Selectional constraints

                    ## The gloss method: a super clever approach to WSD ##
                    * Each sense in a dictionary will have a definition, i.e. a gloss
                    * The gloss method selects the sense of a word based on how much overlap exists
                      between the gloss of that sense and the surround context words in the input
                    * Performs surprisingly well (50-70% accuracy!), and runs very fast

                    ## Selectional constraints ##
                    * Many words take other words as arguments, e.g. A verb takes its subject as an argument
                    * These argument-taking words, selectors, can impose constraints on their arguments.
                    * Selectional constraints require that the arguments have certain meanings.  e.g. The
                      direct object of "eat" must be something that is edible.  Like a carrot.  But not a car.
                      Or an opera.
                    * WSD then becomes a task of determining an interpretation of an input texts that best
                      upholds each word's constraints on its arguments.
                    * Ambiguity can still be a problem.  Constraints aren't specific enough, or conflict:
                        * Bill Clinton ran it.
                        * He ran the race.
                        * Bill Clinton ran the race.

                    ## Supervised methods ##
                    * Use machine learning classifiers to chose word senses
                    * ML classifiers require features to learn from data
                    * Example features:
                        * lemmas (root words)
                        * POS
                        * n-grams and/or chunking
                        * text string of arguments (similar to selectional constraints)
                    * The ML classifier is trained on a marked corpus
